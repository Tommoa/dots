# This file does some preprocessing for notmuch by putting some special tags
# in the correct maildir directories.

# It requires some special setup to work correctly:
#  - notmuch configurations are in .config/notmuch/{name}
#  - mail is kept in ..{name}
#  - the database path is in ..{name}/.notmuch
#  - the mbsync channel that needs to be run is called {name}
#  - if gmail is being used, `notmuch config set user.type gmail` has been run

# We get called in the hooks dir of the notmuch database path.
# Given that notmuch configurations are kept in `.config/notmuch/{name}`,
# we can use this information to get the database path (the same as when
# gotten by calling `notmuch config get database.path`) and the mbsync
# channel.
